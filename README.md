### Getting Started

The finer details of installing the various tools/platforms/prerequisites have
been left as an exercise for the reader.

0. Install [Fuse](https://fusetools.com)
0. Install node/nvm/npm
0. Install F#
0. Clone this repo
0. Run `npm install`
0. Run `./build.sh` or `./build.bat` according to environment

  This will compile F# code in `src/`, watching for changes to recompile.
0. Run `fuse preview ./App/`

  This will run a local preview of the app, also watching for changes.
